Selam!, Hello!, Hola! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a professional transitioning into the exciting world of data science, building on nearly 20 years of diverse experience across three countries, three languages, 
and the joy of raising two kids along the way. Drawing from my background in business management, consultancy, and my passion for food production, 
Iâ€™m now focused on uncovering data-driven solutions and insights grounded in ethics, transparency, and impact.
